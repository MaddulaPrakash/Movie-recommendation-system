# Movie-recommendation-system developed in 2018
A movie recommendation engine to suggest movies based on user's personal interests 

Recommender systems are called information filtering tools, which use big data to recommend likes of the user according to their preference and interest. Moreover, they also help in matching users with similar tastes and interests. Due to this, a central part of websites and e-commerce applications is taken up by the recommender systems. Systems using recommendation algorithms like Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering, etc., are called Recommendation systems. Recommendation systems are transforming the way quiescent websites corresponds with their users. Rather than providing an orthodox experience in which users search for the products which they want and potentially buy products, recommender systems increase communication to provide a better experience. The work would be to implement both collaborative as well as content-based recommenders available and try to extend the knowledge obtained to a more efficient hybrid model. Then benchmark these hybrid algorithms for accuracy and computation time as well.
